PROBLEM STATEMENT
DESIGN A SIMPLE ETL PROCESS – EXTRACT TRANSFORM AND LOAD
FIRST PART
• READ FILES FROM A DIRECTORY
• FOR EACH FILE READ CONTENTS OF THE FILE
• CAPITALIZE THE CONTENTS OF THE FILE
• THEN WRITE THE CAPITALIZED CONTENT INTO ANOTHER OUTPUT FILE WITH THE SAME NAME IN A
DIFFERENT DIRECTORY
SECOND PART:
• READ ALL THE UNIQUE WORDS FROM THE FILE
• FOR EACH WORD CALCULATE THE WORD COUNT
• FOR EXAMPLE: FOR A FILE CONTAINING THE CONTENT
“HELLO WORLD, HELLO”
IN THIS CASE THE SUMMARY WOULD BE
HELLO -> 2
WORLD -> 1

• FOR SIMPLICITY CASES SHOULD BE IGNORED – HELLO AND HELLO MEAN THE SAME WORD
• THIS SUMMARY SHOULD THEN BE ADDED TO AN OUTPUT FILE WITH THE SAME NAME IN A DIFFERENT
DIRECTORY
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
• IT SHOULD BE EASY TO ADD OR REMOVE TRANSFORMATIONS
• INPUT SOURCE COULD CHANGE I.E. –
• IN FUTURE WE COULD READ CONTENTS FROM A SQL TABLE
• OUTPUT SOURCE COULD ALSO CHANGE I.E –
• IN FUTURE WE COULD WRITE CONTENTS TO A SQL TABLE
